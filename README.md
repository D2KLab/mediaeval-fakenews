# FakeNews: Corona Virus and Conspiracies Multimedia Analysis Task

This repository contains D2KLab participation to the MediaEval FakeNews challenge 2021 [[1]](#1).

In order to tackle this challenge, we studied three different kind of approaches. The first uses a combination of TFIDF and machine learning algorithms. The second approach uses Natural Language Inference (NLI) combined with metadata from Wikipedia. The third approach aims at fine-tuning transformer-based models.

The code implementation of the three approachs are available in [./Codes/](./Codes/)
