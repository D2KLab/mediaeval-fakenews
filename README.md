# FakeNews: Corona Virus and Conspiracies Multimedia Analysis Task

This repository contains the D2KLab participation to the [MediaEval 2021 FakeNews Task](https://multimediaeval.github.io/editions/2021/tasks/fakenews/).

We proposed three approaches for which the code implementation are available in [./src/](./src/) for the ones who would like to retrain our models.

An inference notebook is also directly available in [./inference/inference.ipynb](./inference/inference.ipynb). All models are available for download at https://mediaeval-fakenews.tools.eurecom.fr/index.html

The path to the models needs to be specified in the **Input** cell of the inference notebook.

## Approach

In order to tackle this challenge, we studied three different kind of approaches. The first uses a combination of TFIDF and machine learning algorithms. The second approach uses Natural Language Inference (NLI) combined with metadata from Wikipedia. The third approach aims at fine-tuning transformer-based models.
This last approach was the most performing one and got the best results on all the tasks amongst all the participants.

Our runs are available in [./runs/](./runs/).
 - Run 1 is TFIDF
 - Run 2 is CTBert
 - No run 3
 - Run 4 is task-3-CTBert
 - Run 5 is late fusion ensembling

## Results
The results for our 3 approaches on a validation set and on the test set are summarized on this figure.
