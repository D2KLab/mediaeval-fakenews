# FakeNews: Corona Virus and Conspiracies Multimedia Analysis Task

This repository contains D2KLab participation to the MediaEval FakeNews challenge 2021.

In order to tackle this challenge, we studied three different kind of approaches. The first uses a combination of TFIDF and machine learning algorithms. The second approach uses Natural Language Inference (NLI) combined with metadata from Wikipedia. The third approach aims at fine-tuning transformer-based models. In the following sections, we discuss the experiments we pursued for each of these approaches.

The code implementation of the three approachs are available in ./Codes/
